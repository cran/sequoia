#' @title Pedigree Reconstruction
#'
#' @description Perform pedigree reconstruction based on SNP data, including
#'   parentage assignment and sibship clustering.
#'
#' @details For each pair of candidate relatives, the likelihoods are calculated
#'   of them being parent-offspring (PO), full siblings (FS), half siblings
#'   (HS), grandparent-grandoffspring (GG), full avuncular (niece/nephew -
#'   aunt/uncle; FA), half avuncular/great-grandparental/cousins (HA), or
#'   unrelated (U). Assignments are made if the likelihood ratio (LLR) between
#'   the focal relationship and the most likely alternative exceed the threshold
#'   Tassign.
#'
#'   Dummy parents of sibships are denoted by F0001, F0002, ... (mothers)
#'   and M0001, M0002, ... (fathers), are appended to the bottom of the
#'   pedigree, and may have been assigned real or dummy parents themselves (i.e.
#'   sibship-grandparents). A dummy parent is not assigned to singletons.
#'
#'   The genotyping error rate `Err` is by default at locus level, not allele
#'   level: the probability to observe true homozygote \emph{aa} as heterozygote
#'   \emph{Aa} is \eqn{\approx E}, and as alternate homozygote \emph{AA}
#'   \eqn{(E/2)^2}; the probability to observe a true heterozygote as \emph{aa}
#'   = the probability to observe it as \emph{AA} \eqn{= E/2}. This error
#'   structure can be fully customised by providing a 3x3 matrix of observed
#'   genotype (columns) conditional on actual genotype (rows) instead.
#'
#'   Full explanation of the various options and interpretation of the output is
#'   provided in the vignette.
#'
#' @param GenoM  numeric matrix with genotype data: One row per individual, and
#'   one column per SNP, coded as 0, 1, 2 or -9 (missing). See also
#'   \code{\link{GenoConvert}}.
#' @param LifeHistData dataframe with 3 columns (optionally 5):
#'  \describe{
#'  \item{ID}{max. 30 characters long}
#'  \item{Sex}{1 = female, 2 = male, 3 = unknown, 4 = hermaphrodite,
#'            other numbers or NA = unknown}
#' \item{BirthYear }{birth or hatching year, integer, with missing values as NA
#'   or any negative value.}
#' \item{BY.min}{minimum birth year, only used if BirthYear is missing}
#' \item{BY.max}{maximum birth year, only used if BirthYear is missing} }
#' If the species has multiple generations per year, use an integer coding such
#' that the candidate parents' `Birth year' is at least one smaller than their
#' putative offspring's. Column names are ignored, so ensure column order is ID
#' - sex - birth year (- BY.min - BY.max). Individuals do not need to be in the
#' same order as in `GenoM', nor do all genotyped individuals need to be
#' included.
#' @param SeqList list with output from a previous run, to be re-used in the
#'   current run. Used are elements `PedigreePar', `LifeHist', `AgePriors',
#'   `Specs', and `ErrM', and these override the corresponding input parameters.
#'   Not all of these elements need to be present, and all other elements are
#'   ignored. If \code{SeqList$Specs} is provided, all  input parameters with
#'   the same name as its items are ignored, except
#'   \code{Module}/\code{MaxSibIter}.
#' @param Module one of
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{pre}{Only input check, return \code{SeqList$Specs}}
#'     \item{dup}{Also check for duplicate genotypes}
#'     \item{par}{Also perform parentage assignment (genotyped parents to
#'       genotyped offspring)}
#'     \item{ped}{(Also) perform full pedigree reconstruction, including
#'       sibship clustering and grandparent assignment. By far the most time
#'       consuming, and may take several hours for large datasets.}
#'   }
#'   NOTE: \emph{Until `MaxSibIter` is fully deprecated: if `MaxSibIter` differs
#'   from the default (\code{42}), and `Module` equals the default
#'   (\code{'ped'}), MaxSibIter overrides `Module`.}
#' @param MaxSibIter \strong{[will be deprecated]} number of iterations of
#'   sibship clustering, including assignment of grandparents to sibships and
#'   avuncular relationships between sibships. Clustering continues until
#'   convergence or until MaxSibIter is reached. Set to 0 for parentage
#'   assignment only.
#' @param Err estimated genotyping error rate, as a single number or 3x3 matrix.
#'   Details below. The error rate is presumed constant across SNPs, and
#'   missingness is presumed random with respect to actual genotype.
#' @param ErrFlavour function that takes \code{Err} (single number) as input,
#'   and returns a 3x3 matrix of observed (columns) conditional on actual (rows)
#'   genotypes, or choose from inbuilt options 'version2.0', 'version1.3', or
#'   'version1.1', referring to the sequoia version in which they were the
#'   default. Ignored if \code{Err} is a matrix. See \code{\link{ErrToM}}.
#' @param MaxMismatch \strong{DEPRECATED AND IGNORED}. Now calculated
#'   automatically using \code{\link{CalcMaxMismatch}}.
#' @param Tfilter threshold log10-likelihood ratio (LLR) between a proposed
#'   relationship versus unrelated, to select candidate relatives. Typically a
#'   negative value, related to the fact that unconditional likelihoods are
#'   calculated during the filtering steps. More negative values may decrease
#'   non-assignment, but will increase computational time.
#' @param Tassign minimum LLR required for acceptance of proposed relationship,
#'   relative to next most likely relationship. Higher values result in more
#'   conservative assignments. Must be zero or positive.
#' @param MaxSibshipSize  maximum number of offspring for a single individual (a
#'   generous safety margin is advised).
#' @param DummyPrefix character vector of length 2 with prefixes for dummy dams
#'   (mothers) and sires (fathers); maximum 20 characters each. Length 3 vector
#'   in case of hermaphrodites (or default prefix 'H').
#' @param Complex  Breeding system complexity. Either "full" (default), "simp"
#'   (simplified, no explicit consideration of inbred relationships), "mono"
#'   (monogamous).
#' @param Herm  Hermaphrodites, either "no", "A" (distinguish between dam and
#'   sire role, default if at least 1 individual with sex=4), or "B" (no
#'   distinction between dam and sire role). Both of the latter deal with
#'   selfing.
#' @param UseAge  either "yes" (default), "no", or "extra" (additional rounds
#'   with extra reliance on ageprior, may boost assignments but increased risk
#'   of erroneous assignments); used during full reconstruction only.
#' @param args.AP list with arguments to be passed on to
#'   \code{\link{MakeAgePrior}}.
#' @param FindMaybeRel \strong{DEPRECATED AND IGNORED}, advised to run
#'   \code{\link{GetMaybeRel}} separately. TRUE/FALSE to identify pairs of
#'   non-assigned likely relatives after pedigree reconstruction. Can be
#'   time-consuming in large datasets.
#' @param CalcLLR  TRUE/FALSE; calculate log-likelihood ratios for all assigned
#'   parents (genotyped + dummy; parent vs. otherwise related). Time-consuming
#'   in large datasets. Can be done separately with \code{\link{CalcOHLLR}}.
#' @param quiet suppress messages: TRUE/FALSE/"verbose".
#' @param Plot display plots from \code{\link{SnpStats}, \link{MakeAgePrior}},
#'   and \code{\link{SummarySeq}}. Defaults (NULL) to TRUE when quiet=FALSE or
#'   "verbose", and FALSE when quiet=TRUE. If you get error 'figure margins too
#'   large', enlarge the plotting area (drag with mouse). Error 'invalid
#'   graphics state' can be dealt with by clearing the plotting area with
#'   dev.off().

#'   incorporate the information of the assigned parents, and is ready for use
#'   during full pedigree reconstruction.}
#' \item{DummyIDs}{Dataframe with pedigree for dummy individuals, as well as
#' their sex, estimated birth year (point estimate, upper and lower bound of

#' \item{NoLH}{Vector, IDs in genotype data for which no life history data is
